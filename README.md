#  Litra (v0)

Litra is a simple web app that converts Latin script into the Amharic "Fidel" script through phonetic transliteration.

##  Translation vs. Transliteration
It is important to know the difference:
* **Translation:** Converts **meaning**. (e.g., "Hello" ➡️ "ሰላም")
* **Transliteration:** Converts **sounds/letters**. (e.g., "Selam" ➡️ "ሰላም")

##  How to Use
1. **Launch:** [Open Litra](https://malchiel-d.github.io/litra/).
2. **Input:** Enter a phonetic letter in the input box.
3. **Convert:** Click **Convert** to see the Ge'ez character.
