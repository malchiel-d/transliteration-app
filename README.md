# Transliteration App (v0)

> This is a **test project** for transliteration.

## What it does
This is a simple web app that converts certain letters from Latin script to a target script (currently only "A" → "አ").

## Difference Between Translation and Transliteration
- **Translation**: Converts the **meaning** of text from one language to another.  
  - Example: "Hello" -> "ሰላም"
- **Transliteration**: Converts **letters or sounds** from one script to another, keeping the pronunciation.  
  - Example: "Selam" -> "ሰላም" 

## How to Use
1. [click here](https://malchiel-d.github.io/transliteration-app/).
2. Enter a letter in the input box.
3. Click **Convert** to see the result.

## Notes
- Currently, only "A" is supported.
- This is version **v0**, just for testing purposes.
